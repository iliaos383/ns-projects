## Project summary ##

Create open source high performance cjdns Route Server in the PKT network. PKT ecosystem includes a special broadcasting network and a protocol, that can be used for building decentralized VPN services and Web 3.0. PKT team is going to create a worldwide online community of PKT protocol adopters and unite all supporters of decentralized web. Also PKT is a bandwidth market based on cjdns protocol, which rewards its members for bandwidth delegation. 

## Project deliverables ##
This project will deliver new open source software which will:
* Be licensed GPL-3.0-or-later
* The maintainer of this software will be: ___
* The software will be hosted in: https://github.com/<where> or in https://github.com/pkt-cash/ if the Network Steward prefers.

Note on delivery: the team 
* would plan to set up the software development process in two week long spring
* would be ready to discuss the current spring results and plans for next sprint every two weeks with the Stewards and other stakeholders



## Success criteria ##

Verify that performance of cjdns Route Server has significantly increased.
 
## Milestones ##
Creation of open source cjdns Route Server with high performance. Here are milestones for the progress of the project by which the network steward can evaluate the success of the project.

### Milestone 0: Kickoff
At the beginning of the project, the Network Steward will pay out 6M of PKT to the applicant.

## Milestone 1: Development of Rust libraries ##
Features expected to be completed include rust versions of cjdnsadmin, cjdnsann, cjdnskeys, cjdnsniff, and cjdnsplice

Upon the completion of this milestone, a report will be made for the Network Steward and if the Network Steward accepts this report, 6M of PKT will be paid out.

## Milestone 2: Rust version of cjdns node ##
Rust version of cjdnsnode should have these features:
* able to pull from another node (implement peer.js)
* has an implementation of handleAnnounce that verifies the announcement and returns a correct stateHash
    * implements the `/dump` http endpoint from cjdnsnode
    * uses threads to the greatest extent practical, with consideration to the fact that it may be interconnected with many peers sending large amounts of data

Upon the completion of this milestone, a report will be made for the Network Steward and if the Network Steward accepts this report, 6M of PKT will be paid out.

## Milestone 3: Evolution of Rust version of cjdnsnode ## 
Complete evolution of Rust version of cjdnsnode including:
* onSubnodeMessage implementation supporting 'pn', 'gr' and 'ann' messages
* `/ni` and `/walk` http endpoints
* uses threads to ensure that:
  * multiple requests to 'gr' can be processed at the same time
  * multiple requests to 'ann' endpoint can be processed at the same time
  * requests to 'gr' can be processed in parallel with requests to 'ann'
  * re-builds of the dijkstra tree are performed in parallel and exchanged with the live tree in order that lookups are never blocked.

Upon the completion of this milestone, a report will be made for the Network Steward and if the Network Steward accepts this report, 6M of PKT will be paid out.

## Milestone 4: Iterative updates to dijkstra tree ##
Two trees are present, one of which is active and the other is being updated. Periodically, the two are switched and then the updates are re-played to the one which is now out of date.

This constitutes the end of the project, at the end of Milestone 4, a report will be made for the Network Steward and if the Network Steward accepts this report, 6M of PKT will be paid out.

  https://github.com/CJDNS-Development-Team/CJDNS/tree/master/netchecksum

Binaries
--------

Along with the above libaries there are also three binaries: cjdnsadmin, dumpdht, dumpctrl.

All these binaries require connection to a working cjdns router to allow to send control command and sniff traffic.

Examples:

$ cargo build --release

$ ./target/release/cjdnsadmin 'ping()'

$ ./target/release/dumpdht

$ ./target/release/dumpctrl

## Milestone 2 (M2) report - 2020-10-24 ##
Rust version of cjdns node is completed

Project Results (Required)
Rust version of cjdnsnode has the following features:

Able to pull from another node (implement peer.js). This is implemented in https://github.com/CJDNS-Development-Team/CJDNS/tree/supernode/cjdns-snode/src/peer package.

Has an implementation of handleAnnounce that verifies the announcement. This is implemented in https://github.com/CJDNS-Development-Team/CJDNS/tree/supernode/cjdns-snode/src/server package.

Built-in http server has the following endpoints:

http://localhost:3333/ which dumps some debug statistics in JSON format.
http://localhost:3333/dump which dumps internal state in some binary format (obsolete and not really required anymore).
http://localhost:3333/cjdnsnode_websocket which is a WebSocket endpoint and used to communicate with other supernodes.
On startup, connections established to other supernodes specified in config file using WebSocket-based protocol, and node information is gathered from these peer supernodes.

Also, incoming WebSocket connections are possible from other supernodes, for the same information exchange.

Application uses async tasks (Tokio-based) to achieve hight performance, so it can be interconnected with many peers sending large amounts of data.

Next milestone will be to finish the server package (see above) to implement the rest of http endpoints and route building.

Binary
There is only one binary: cjsnd-snode.

This binary requires a config file, which can be specified via command line arg.

The example config is https://github.com/CJDNS-Development-Team/CJDNS/blob/supernode/cjdns-snode/config.example.json.

To build & run, use the following:

$ cargo build --release

$ RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/cjdns-snode --config cjdns-snode/config.example.json

This will run the program with some verbose logging. Use RUST_LOG=warn to suppress that log output.


## Milestone 3 (M3)  Evolution of Rust version of cjdnsnode - 2020-11-14 ##

Rust version of cjdnsnode has the following features:
    * onSubnodeMessage implementation supports 'pn', 'gr' and 'ann' messages;
    * built-in http server supports /ni and /walk endpoints;
    * all processing code is asynchronous.
